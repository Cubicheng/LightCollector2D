## Game Introduction

- Gru lives in an underground tribe that needs light to survive. **They eat light!**

- But now, their light is running out. The tribe's leader sends Gru to the surface. Gru is the **Collector**.

- You play as Gru. You must constantly find and collect light to **keep yourself alive** in the dark. Travel through dangerous places like the deep Abyss and a huge Ant Nest.

- Get to the surface and bring back the light to save your tribe!

## How to Play

- Use the **A** and **D** keys to move left and right. Press **W** or the **Space** keys to jump.

- ***Find*** the Light Orbs, ***collect*** and ***eat*** them!

- Collect the Light Orbs **fast**! Don't run out of light and get swallowed by the darkness.

Once the corresponding ability is unlocked:

- **Double Jump**: You can press **W** or the **Space** twice to perform a double jump.

- **Light Shot**: Press **K** to launch a small light bullet and light up the area ahead.

- **Flash**: Press **J** to trigger a flash that lights up the entire map.


- For the best audio experience, please use the x64 version.
